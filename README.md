# Corewar

Epitech's project from Semester 2.

The corewar/corewar executable is a virtual machine, which allows you to run combat between heroes compiled with the asm/asm executable.

If you compile with the variable "BONUS" to "yes" in the Makefile :

    - A decompiler executable (/bonus/decompiler) which allows you to turn .cor files into .s
    - Unlimited heros in the VM
    - A wonderful Website accessible to all people in one IONIS school
        - You can upload .cor or .s (if so, it will be turned to .cor with our asm)
        - Fight versus other people's heroes
        - Ranking system

Realized with Luka Boulagnon, Ludovic Petrenko and Lucas Troncy.

ASM grade : 19.75 / 20
